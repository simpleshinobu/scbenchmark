### Prepare Data and Env

Directly download our preprocessed data:
- [train_data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u2I18NfBUTBZY_gUmlXWcoibaLyPy1WT/view?usp=sharing) and [test_data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yMX5gMmj3npBUN8lzQx7gHe6MBlTj9oX/view?usp=sharing) into the `./data/` directory.
- [Downstream cls](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JyUrqOFs1ZskrEHvWR0SO378J0KhEkVG/view?usp=sharing) and [Downstream pert](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0CNeJ9_K1x_BwJX0Iwy3-0G5isICffI/view?usp=sharing) into the `./data/downstreams/classification` and `./data/downstreams/perturbation` directory. (e.g., data/downstreams/classification/processed_data/ircolitis_data.pt)

Alternatively, create the pretraining dataset from scratch (several hours).
Run the following command:
```
cd data/cellxgene
python download_data.py --index-dir ./idx_dir --output-dir ./data_raw --vocab-file vocab.json --scoutput-path ./data_scbank --link-dir ./all_counts
```
Then, create your own train data and test data. Note that, downloading the whole data could easily test the Table 6 in the main paper.

When prepare environment, please install the suitable version of pytorch (the default is 2.3.1) and refer to requirements.txt to install others, and note that datasets=2.16.0 is essential.

For example, for CUDA 12.4:
```
pip install torch==2.3.1+cu124 torchvision==0.15.1+cu124 torchaudio==2.3.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124/torch_stable.html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
for further prepare your data, please refer to scGPT to set your environment.
### Pretrain Models

Run the baseline model (last lline in Table 1 in the main paper) (6 layers, 256 dimensions, use mvc, use weighted sampling, cls as cell feature, log1p preprocess) with the following command:

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 --nnodes=1 --node_rank=0 --master_addr="localhost" --master_port=6667 train_baseline.py --epochs 10 --batch_size 128 --lr 2e-4 -s ./save_pretrain/baseline --nlayers 6 --embsize 256 --preprocess_mode none --use_weighted_sampling --use_mvc --model_structure transformer
```
Note that the evaluation regression loss is only for reference and not reported in the main paper. Please change --model_structure to test other structures (for cnn and linear, please add --train_maxseq 511 --test_maxseq 511 for valid input), change --preprocess_mode --use_weighted_sampling --use_mvc to test other settings.

### Downstream Tasks

Run the following command for downstream tasks (change model path before running):
```
bash bash_downstreams.sh
```
Please refer to the "Expression Classification Datasets" section in the main paper to ensure that the dataset names in the code correspond with those in the paper.
